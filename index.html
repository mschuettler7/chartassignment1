	Since the pandemic, dumping of anything between mattresses to entire kitchens has been ramping up in outer-borough neighborhoods. Garbage can be found on sidewalks, parks, and in other community spaces, impacting the quality of life. 
</p>
	
	<p>
	Since 2021, Queens has had the second highest number of 311 complaints at 30,000 in the last four years. That’s double the number of complaints in Manhattan. Data analysis shows that neighborhoods on the outskirts of the borough are the hardest hit. 
	</p>

	<p>
	“Most illegal dumping occurs in quieter, out-of-the way locations in the outer boroughs,” said Department of Sanitation Press Secretary, Vincent Gragnani.

				It’s unclear why illegal dumping ramped up during the pandemic, though Gragnani believes people just got used to dumping for free. 
</p>
<p>
				“In most cases, it is contractors looking to evade the fees of properly disposing of construction material,” Gragnani said. In 2022, the city added categories like “Chronic dumping” to the 311 system, so residents could file complaints about garbage more accurately.
			</p>
			<p>

				Reporting illegal dumping is an important step towards fixing the problem, but Gragnani cautions against assuming complaints directly correlate with dumping rates. 
			</p>
			<p>

				“Increases in 311 reports of illegal dumping don’t necessarily mean there is more illegal dumping – only that people are reporting it more, which is great and a sign that people know there will be consequences for the dumpers,” Gragnani said.

				Though illegal dumping spiked after the pandemic, the rate in the top five dumped-on neighborhoods seems to have plateaued. Astoria and Long Island City (Community Board 01) is the only central community board that makes the top five. 

</p>
<p>
				This trend could be attributed to the DSNY's crack down on illegal dumping. A network of over 300 cameras are stationed around the city to catch illegal dumpers. Once caught, dumpers are fined them and their vehicles impounded. 
			</p>
<p>
				This year, the DSNY has issued over 200 summonses, each starting at $4,000 dollars. 
			</p>
			<p>

“Crooks who are dumping trash here are on notice: If you dump on our neighborhoods, we will catch you, we will impound your vehicle, and you will pay,” Gragnani said.
